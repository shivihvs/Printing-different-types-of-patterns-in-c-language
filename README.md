This project consist of the easiest ways to print different kinds of patterns in c language.

1.In the first problem we will print the pattern of following type given below,containing number from 1 to n.

                            4 4 4 4 4 4 4 
                            4 3 3 3 3 3 4   
                            4 3 2 2 2 3 4   
                            4 3 2 1 2 3 4   
                            4 3 2 2 2 3 4   
                            4 3 3 3 3 3 4   
                            4 4 4 4 4 4 4  
                            
                          (PATTERN FOR N=4)
                            
 The element you want to print find the distance of it from all the four sides and see from which side the distance is mininmum and 
 then subtract that distance from " n" (where n is the input given by the user) and you will get the number you want to print.
 Example:
 if you have n =4 then in second row and second coloumn you get 4-1=3 becz minimum distance was 1 from left side.
 The above pattern shown is for input 4(that is n=4).
